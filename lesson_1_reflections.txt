to find the difference between two files the following command shall be used
diff -u old_file.txt new_file.txt
this helps in finding difference line by line in these two files
thus if there is some errors in the different versions of it it could be caught.
example if your first file had 6 errors, and second file had 7 errors then you can compare those two files and figure out if there is any change in those two files

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped me by comparing and showing the difference line by line. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would save a lot of time as I wouldnt have to go through the whole program to find that one mistake

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Pros 
more control on when to save.
more logical.
easier to revert the necessary changes.
Cons,
I might do it too infrequently/frequently so that its hard to find two logical versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because, git is made for code and code is usually interrelated with each other 
so git allows saving multiple file commit at a time, 
while google doc is not made for code so it treats each file seprately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists the logs of all the git commits
git diff is like regular diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I am confident that git has my back and i can change it anytime

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
for my future code, lol
