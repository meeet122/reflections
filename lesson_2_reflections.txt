What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when I initialize git repo, .git is created where the metadata is stored and then you 
can treat that folder as a repo, we need to do it to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
you can use git diff to make sure you have one commit per logical change
