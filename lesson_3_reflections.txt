When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to publish my work on cloud or work with other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes You would not want to pull from the github, i.e you
get more control if the you have freedom of syncinng files when you want to.
